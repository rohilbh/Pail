# pail

Have a movie that you've been meaning to get to but never remember when you're browsing online? Meaning to check out that restaurant that your friend told you about but that you can't remember the name of? Just put it into your Pail and not only will you have an organized record of all the things you've been meaning to check out, but Pail will remind you about them at the opportune moments.

TODO: UI Design, better reminder algorithm
